## Reading Order

All report content is in the directory:

* [Report](/Report)

Our report should be read in the following order:

* 01-Introduction
* 02-Graph Derivation
* 03-Scala Processing
* 04-Graph Analysis
* 05-Computational Performance
* 06-Pregel vs GraphFrames
* 07-Conclusion

## Requirements

Section 03 of the report requires the installation of IntelliJ IDEA IDE, where you can import the folder as a project. I am sure there is a more optimal way to run this, however this is most likely to work. The important files are found in src/main/scala. test, is the main file that runs the code on the dataset. Timer is the code for the timing test, however to run this you are required to comment out the majority of the code in test.main() and uncomment the first line (there is a comment to highlight this line). 

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own directories:

* [Bill-Evidence](/Bill-Evidence)
* [Naz-Evidence](/Naz-Evidence)
* [Adam-Evidence](/Adam-Evidence)

Cheers
