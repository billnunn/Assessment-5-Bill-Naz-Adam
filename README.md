## Reading Order

All report content is in the directory:

Our report should be read in the following order:

* 01-Introduction

* 05-Computational Performance
* 06-Pregel vs GraphFrames

## Requirements

Section 03 of the report requires the installation of IntelliJ IDEA IDE, where you can import the folder as a project. I am sure there is a more optimal way to run this, however this is most likely to work.
